 # *C*ross-*P*latform *P*ackage *M*anager <sub>(CPPM)</sub>
CPPM is the **C**ross-**P**latform **P**ackage **M**anager, a shell-based
command-line installer that works on **Windows, macOS, and GNU/Linux**.
## Usage
Developer binary builds (for Microsoft Windows) are at https://github.com/Tyler887/CPPM/actions.

Released python scripts and executable Windows files (including installers) are at https://github.com/Tyler887/CPPM/releases. The latest stable release files can be found at https://github.com/Tyler887/CPPM/releases/latest.

**Note for users on Windows that used the Installer:** The `cppm` command opens the CPPM shell you recently installed.
If you do not want a `cppm` command, uninstall CPPM and download the main executable shell.<br />
Also, if you want to install CPPM into the `Program Files` or `Program Files (x86)` folder, you must be
an administrator on your Microsoft Windows system.

Your CPPM installation may be signed by the GNU Privacy Guard.
### GH Actions
CPPM is a shell, so CPPM must be set as the shell in the step using it.
